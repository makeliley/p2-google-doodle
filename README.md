1. A brave Soviet named Laika was the first animal to be launched into orbit. De-orbiting techniques had not been engineered at the time, so Laika was not expected to survive their trip. Scientists didn't think humans could survive the harsh conditions of space travel, and sure enough, Laika overheated within a few hours. Laika provided some of the first data on living beings in space which has proven to be invaluable to our specie's space travel.
2. Laika was no purebred entitled dog. She was actually a stray scientists found wandering the streets of Moscow, chosen specifically because she had already endured the cold harsh conditions of homelessness, and therefore hopefully would have a better chance in space. Scientists nicknamed her Kudryavka (Russian for Little Curly), Zhuchka (Little Bug), and Limonchik (Little Lemon), but Laika was the name that went down in history books.
3. Regarding her personality, she has been described as phlegmatic, quiet, and charming. To condition dogs for space, they would be confined to small cages that progressively became smaller and smaller so they would be conditioned for a cramped spaceflight. They were also trained to eat a high nutrition gel that would serve as all of their sustenance in space. Surgeries were conducted upon the dogs to place cables that would measure their blood pressure, pulse, and breathing.
4. Unfortunately, Laika was not the first dog to die for her country. Although missions since have been designed to recover the dogs, 5 others were tragically killed: Bars and Lisichka, killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch in 1960, Pchyolka and Mushka, when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed to prevent other countries from inspecting the capsule after atmospheric reentry in 1960.
